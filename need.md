now use razorpay for payment processing and implement and robust payment and order management system .
create an snapshot of cart and store it when new order is created .

order model acc to would have

payment id
totalwithoutDiscount
totalPayableAmount
totalDiscount

and another model for delivery tracking details
and one for payments
also implement partial cancellation and refund system
with an great payout system . which tracks payout as an whole and also as an individual order

feel free to make any changes you like to the proposed schema just make sure everything is covered and implemented in best way possible.
